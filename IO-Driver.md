# IO Driver

## Vision
Your job is to directly interface with the hard drive.  You are the first in the leg of converting physical constructs into software purity.

## Acts 1 - 4
When a color block is requested it is your job to let the hard drive know which color blocks you need.  You are also the gatekeeper to not let any other colors get past that have not been requested.
