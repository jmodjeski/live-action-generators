# Hard drive

## Vision
Your job is to pass blocks according to the colors requested from you to the best of your ability.

## Acts 1 - 4
When a color block is requested, you must reach into the primary basket and grab a block out.  If the block matches a color that has been requested, pass it along to the actor on your right.

*Color blind participant, speed is better than accuracy.  If the blocks are in a phase that is troublesome for you, pass them along and let the next level sort them out.  This will make the presentation MUCH more interesting*

*Not Colorblind participant, feel free to toss in an invalid block from time to time.  This will keep others on their toes and make the presentation more interesting*
